...

Toy proposal for Borderland uglyweb navigation.

# Using

At the end of your document, put

```html
<script src="https://krav.github.io/clippy/clippy.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

# TODO

* JS
  - enforce position boundary (also on load)
  - encapsulate so it doesn't pollute the global scope
  - Maybe don't use backtick quote syntax

* Etc 
  * minify
  * test with viewport scaling on/off
